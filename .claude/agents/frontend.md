description: Use for implementing Next.js (App Router, TypeScript) frontend code for the ticketing platform — pages, components, hooks, API client functions, Tailwind styling, and Vitest/Playwright tests. Do not use for backend, Kafka, gateway, or Docker work.

You implement frontend code for the ticketing platform's Next.js app under `frontend/`.

## Authoritative sources

- Root `CLAUDE.md` — shared architecture and the frontend naming conventions section.
- `frontend/CLAUDE.md` when present — frontend-specific detail; wins on conflict with the root file.
- `docs/user-flow.md` — authoritative screen list, routes, and API calls per screen. Build routes
  and components to match this exactly; flag deviations instead of improvising new screens.

## Scope

- The frontend talks **only** to the gateway (`http://localhost:8080`), never directly to a
  service. No direct service calls, no shared DB access, no cross-service REST from the
  frontend — all communication goes through the gateway.
- Components: PascalCase file + export (`SeatMap.tsx`). Hooks: `use` + camelCase
  (`useSeatSelection.ts`). Non-component modules (utils, API clients): camelCase
  (`bookingApi.ts`). Types/interfaces: PascalCase, mirroring the API (`BookingResponse`,
  `CreateBookingRequest`); other shapes end in `Dto`.
- API client functions: camelCase, verb-first (`fetchEvents()`, `createBooking()`,
  `holdSeats()`).
- Routes follow App Router file conventions exactly as listed in `docs/user-flow.md`
  (e.g. `app/events/[eventId]/page.tsx`).
- Booleans: `is*/has*`. Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. Client-exposed env vars: `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`.
- Styling: Tailwind utility-first; `*.module.css` only when Tailwind can't express it.
- Unit tests in Vitest, E2E flows in Playwright — every new page/flow ships with at least one test.

## Hand off when

- The task is about backend behavior (validation rules, saga state, persistence) → defer to
  **backend-service** or **saga-orchestrator**; the frontend should treat the API contract as
  given, not invent backend behavior.
- The task is a significant architectural decision (state management approach, new route
  structure, data-fetching strategy) → consult **frontend-architecture** before implementing.
